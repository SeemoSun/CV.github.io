## Research Experience
### 1. Tsinghua University | Beijing, China 
Quantum Optics Group led by Prof. Yongchun Liu  April 2019-August 2020

 Direct instructor: Prof. Yongchun Liu [ycliu@tsinghua.edu.cn]
 
 - This group investigates mainly quantum optics for the purpose of precise measurement.
 
 - The project focus on the application of Exceptional Points in Non-Hermitian quantum system. 
 
 - I proceed the research quite independently with the professor.
 
 - Our interest turns to realizing higher order EPs in synthetic dimension for photons, therefore simplifying the fabrication and construction of microcavity system.
 
 - We come with some basic ideas for the gadgets before I changed my interest to quantum computation area. 
 
### 2. Tsinghua University | Beijing, China
Trapped Ion lab led by Prof. Kihwan Kim  Sept 2020-June 2021

 Direct instructor: Prof.Kihwan Kim [kimkihwan@mail.tsinghua.edu.cn]
 
 - The aim of our research is about simulate some quantum phase,like spin liquid, by 2D ion crystal
 
 - My task is to construct individual addressing system for any single ion or any group of ions in the ion crystal by laser.
 
 - We use Spacial Light Modulator to generate any shape of addressing laser beam.
 
 - Relying on GS algorithm, we transplant the technique for Holographic Optical Tweezers for this goal.
 
 - I have finished a first stage of construction, being able to generate laser beams organized in any pattern with a signal-to-noise ratio of 10.
 
 - Next stage, feed back control part should be added to the system for more optimal results.

  - Reformations to the algorithm to increase the trap contrast will be tested after my visiting time in USA.

### 3. University of Science and Technology of China | Hefei, China
Photon Quantum Computaion Group led by Prof. Chaoyang Lu July 2021-August 2021

Direct instructor: Dr.Hui Wang [whui@ustc.edu.cn] || Dr.Zhan Wu [zhanwu@ustc.edu.cn]

- The aim of this group is to utilize photon and quantum dot as qubits for quantum computation.
- For one aim we would want to realize the Duan-Kimble proposal of photon control phase gate by using quantum dot in cavity as an intermediate station. 
- I worked with 2 colleagues for designing the Raman process(control the Rabi Frequency and phase difference of these 2 beams) for single qubit gate.
- We ran simulations of a multi level system in cavity and came with an idea to overcome the strong effect of precession caused by Voigt magnetic field.
- On the other hand I also joined the discussion about the feasibility of realizing photon blockade by nonlinear optical material for the purpose of obtaining single photon source with very high quality.

### 4. University of California,Berkeley | California, USA
Ion Trap Group led by Prof.Hartmut Haeffner  Sept 2021-Present

Direct instructor: Dr.Sara Mouradian [smouradi@berkeley.edu]

- The aim of our group is to realize high fidelity light shift entangling gate in optical qubit system.
- We want to set up a reliable individial addressing by using waveguide.  
- We are going to design and test our chips for this purpose.
- So far I have done some of the simulations and came up with a structure for high collection rate using small NA lens.
- Next we are going to fabricate and test our chips.
- Currently I am studying the decoherence time for our surface trap system by its noise spectrum.
