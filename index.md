## Research Experience
### 1. Tsinghua University | Beijing, China 
Quantum Optics Group led by Prof. Yongchun Liu  April 2019-August 2020

 Direct instructor: Prof. Yongchun Liu [ycliu@tsinghua.edu.cn]
 
 - The project focus on the application of Exceptional Points in Non-Hermitian quantum system. 
 
 - Realizing higher order EPs in synthetic dimension for photons will simplify the fabrication and construction of microcavity system.
 
 - Passive system with spin-momentum locking in synthetic dimension might map an effective arbitrary order of EPs
 
### 2. Tsinghua University | Beijing, China
Trapped Ion lab led by Prof. Kihwan Kim  Sept 2020-June 2021

 Direct instructor: Prof.Kihwan Kim [kimkihwan@mail.tsinghua.edu.cn]
 
 - The system is 2D ion crystal to study quantum many body system.
 - My task is to construct individual addressing system for any single ion or any group of ions in the ion crystal by laser.
 - Spacial Light Modulator with computer calculated phase pattern
 - Relying on a modified GS algorithm 
 - Finished a first stage of construction, being able to generate laser beams organized in any pattern with a signal-to-noise ratio of 10.
 - Next stage, feed back control part should be added to the system for more optimal results.
 - Reformations to the algorithm to increase the trap contrast will be tested after my visiting time in USA.

### 3. University of Science and Technology of China | Hefei, China
Photon Quantum Computaion Group led by Prof. Chaoyang Lu July 2021-August 2021

Direct instructor: Dr.Hui Wang [whui@ustc.edu.cn] | Dr.Zhan Wu [zhanwu@ustc.edu.cn]

- Goal is to the Duan-Kimble proposal of photon control phase gate by using quantum dot in cavity as an intermediate station. 
- Designing the Raman process(control the Rabi Frequency and phase difference of these 2 beams) for single qubit gate.
- Simulating Raman transition of a multi level system in cavity to find best phase difference between Raman beams to mitigate the strong effect of precession caused by Voigt magnetic field
- Joined the discussion about the feasibility of realizing photon blockade by nonlinear optical material for the purpose of obtaining single photon source with very high quality.

### 4. University of California,Berkeley | California, USA
Ion Trap Group led by Prof.Hartmut Haeffner  Sept 2021-Present

Direct instructor: Dr.Sara Mouradian [smouradi@berkeley.edu]

- Try to realize high fidelity light shift entangling gate in optical qubit system.
- Set up a reliable individial addressing system using waveguide.  
- Found grating structure be helpful for concentrating EM field flux on the waveguide faucet
- Simulations verify the structure for high collection rate(over 80%) using relative small NA(0.4) lens.
- Next we are going to fabricate and test our chips.
- Currently I am studying the decoherence time for our ions trapped by surface trap with addressing light system by its noise spectrum.
